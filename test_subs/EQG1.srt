1
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,120
Your very first princess summit.
You must be over the moon, Twilight.

2
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,840
I am excited. But, to be honest,
I'm a little nervous, too.

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,330
You're 'nervicited'!

4
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,560
It's like you wanna jump up and down
and yell "YAY ME!!"

5
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,759
But you also wanna curl up
in a teeny-tiny ball

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,860
and hide at the same time!

7
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,980
We've all been there!

8
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,850
I'm there almost every day.

9
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,640
You've got no reason to fret, Twi.
Everything's gonna be just–

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,150
TWILIGHT!

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,010
Oh, sorry, darling,

12
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,000
but I just realized
you're not wearing your crown.

13
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,750
You haven't forgotten it
back in Ponyville, have you?

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,830
It's in my bag.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,600
Just feel a little self-conscious
about wearing it.

16
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,710
Haven't really gotten accustomed
to these yet, either.

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,960
You are a princess now, Twilight.
Embrace it!

18
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,870
I'm telling you,
if I had a crown like that,

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,970
I would never take it off.
Why, I'd sleep in the thing.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,790
Her highness,
Princess Twilight Sparkle!

21
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,380
Twilight! I haven't seen you
since the coronation!

22
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,830
We have so much to discuss.

23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,460
But it can wait until tomorrow.
You all look tired from your journey.

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,550
Now, off to bed, all of you.

25
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,860
What's wrong, Twilight?

26
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,730
I don't know, Spike.
I'm just... worried I guess.

27
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,020
Princess Cadance was given
the Crystal Empire to rule over.

28
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,616
What if, now that I'm a princess,

29
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,330
Celestia expects me
to lead a kingdom of my own?

30
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,790
That would be awesome!

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,510
No, it would not!

32
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,580
Just because I have this crown
and these wings, it doesn't mean

33
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,760
I'll be a good leader!

34
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,540
Aw, sure you will, Twilight.

35
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,070
Now come on,
you should get some shut-eye.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,630
Big day tomorrow!

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,600
Can't... tuck...!

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,330
Just trying to get comfortable!

39
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,710
My Little Pony: Equestria Girls

42
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,530
Huh? What?

43
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,770
My crown!
She's got my crown!

44
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,200
Stop! Thief!

45
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,190
She's stolen my crown!

46
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,800
Stop!

47
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,900
What did you do with my crown?

48
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,960
Sorry it had to be this way...

49
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,520
Princess!

50
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,790
Who was that?

51
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,860
Sunset Shimmer.
A former student of mine.

52
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,490
She began her studies with me
not long before Twilight.

53
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,610
But when she did not get what
she wanted as quickly as she liked,

54
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,790
she turned cruel and dishonest.

55
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,310
I tried to help her,

56
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,460
but she eventually decided to abandon
her studies and pursue her own path.

57
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,870
One that has sadly led her
to stealing your crown.

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,370
She replaced Twilight's
with this one.

59
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,260
I suppose Sunset Shimmer thought

60
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,840
you wouldn't notice right away
that this was not yours.

61
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,075
And by the time you did,

62
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:06,700
it would be too late to go after
your crown and Element of Harmony.

63
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,560
But I don't understand!
Where did she go?

64
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,350
Why did she take the crown?

65
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,730
You'll soon know more about
this place than even I do.

66
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,890
This is no ordinary mirror.

67
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,330
It is a gateway to another world.

68
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,130
A gateway that opens
once every thirty moons.

69
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,380
Sparkly!

70
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,590
It has always been kept in
the throne room of Canterlot Castle.

71
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,900
But when Princess Cadance
took over the Crystal Empire,

72
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:36,010
we sent it here
for her to watch over.

73
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,130
I had always hoped that Sunset Shimmer
would someday use it to return,

74
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,520
to come back to Equestria
seeking my guidance.

75
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,190
Obviously,
this is not what has happened.

76
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,900
Twilight,

77
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,750
you must use the mirror
to go into this other world

78
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,900
and retrieve your crown.

79
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,580
Without it, the other Elements
of Harmony have no power

80
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,750
and Equestria is left without one
of its most important means of defense.

81
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,370
Your crown does not belong in the place
Sunset Shimmer now calls home.

82
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,999
And in her possession,
your Element of Harmony

83
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,920
will no doubt be used to bring harm
to the inhabitants of this other realm.

84
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,600
They will not have the power
to defend themselves.

85
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,680
You understand
the importance of your task?

86
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,360
Of course.

87
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,560
Good. Then you must go at once.

88
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,020
She's going,
we're going with her!

89
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,500
Right, girls?

90
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:38,180
Ooooh! I'm so 'nervicited'!

91
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,320
You do realize that's not a real word,
right?

92
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,410
I'm afraid I can't let you go.

93
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,580
What?! Why not?!

94
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,450
Sending all of you could upset
the balance of this alternate world,

95
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,467
creating havoc
that would make it impossible

96
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,630
for Twilight to get the crown back
from Sunset Shimmer.

97
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,840
This is something
Princess Twilight must do alone.

98
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,480
Time is of the essence.

99
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,260
On the third day, when the moon
reaches its peak in the night sky,

100
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,130
the gateway will close.
And once it does,

101
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,860
it will be another thirty moons before
you will be able to use it to return.

102
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,610
- It's alright, Twi!
- You'll be back before you know it!

103
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,230
Spike, no!

104
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,380
Huh, Twilight?

105
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,830
Spike!
You're not supposed to...

106
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,180
Spike? Are you a...

107
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,600
dog?

108
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,120
I think so...

109
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,800
But I have no idea what you are!

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,830
Twilight,
you have to get it together!

111
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,180
What does the rest of me look like?

112
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,280
Um, like you. Only not you.

113
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,130
Your muzzle's really small.

114
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,730
My muzzle?!

115
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,580
Are you gonna scream again?

116
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,630
Where are we?

117
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,460
I don't know.

118
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,530
But that must serve
as the gateway back to Equestria.

119
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,730
We need to find my crown
as soon as possible and get back there.

120
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,750
I suggest we start searching
the castle first.

121
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,100
Works for me.

122
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,720
Yeah, I don't think that's how
the new you is supposed to–

123
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,920
Come on, Spike.

124
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,140
I do not wanna be like this
for longer than I have to.

125
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,660
Look on the bright side.

126
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,990
You don't have those pesky wings
to worry about anymore.

127
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,760
My magic! It isn't working!

128
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,960
Makes sense.

129
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,880
You don't exactly have your horn.

130
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,170
WHAT?!

131
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,810
We really need to find you a mirror.

132
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,940
What do you think, Spike?

133
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,610
Other artifacts she's stolen
from Equestria?

134
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,830
What am I?

135
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,850
You okay?

136
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't think this is a castle.

137
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,060
<i>I've never seen a place
that's quite like this </i>

138
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,060
<i>Everything is turned around</i>

139
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,860
<i>This crazy world is upside-down </i>

140
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,320
<i>Getting on my feet
it's the hand that I was dealt </i>

141
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,399
<i>But I don't have
much time with them </i>

142
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,530
<i>Got to learn all that I can </i>

143
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,350
<i>They don't use any magic
or fly with any wings </i>

144
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,600
<i>I don't get these funny clothes,
skinny legs or tiny nose </i>

145
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,270
<i>Everything's confusing
when it seems so new </i>

146
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,320
<i>But I look a little closer
and it starts to feel familiar too </i>

147
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,350
<i>What a strange new world
(what a strange new world) </i>

148
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,940
<i>I'm trying to make heads
or tails of this strange new world</i>

149
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,030
<i>Sorting through the small details
of this strange new world </i>

150
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,470
<i>What a strange new world </i>

151
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,370
I'm really sorry.

152
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,850
I just found it, and I thought
I should give it to her.

153
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,410
I didn't know you had dropped it.

154
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,620
Well, I did!

155
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,990
And I was about to get it before
you swooped in and ruined everything!

156
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,770
You shouldn't pick up things
that don't belong to you.

157
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,820
It... doesn't really
belong to you, either.

158
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,050
Excuse me?!?

159
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,910
Nothing...

160
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,540
That's what I thought.
It's as good as mine, and you know it.

161
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,900
You really are pathetic.

162
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,360
It's no wonder your best friends
are all stray animals.

163
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,770
How dare you speak to her that way!

164
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,760
What did you say?

165
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,260
I said...

166
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,990
how dare you speak to her that way!

167
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,980
You must be new here.

168
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,770
I can speak to anyone any way I want.

169
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,120
I can't believe you did that!

170
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,940
I couldn't just stand there.

171
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,950
Well, it's just that nobody ever
stands up to Sunset Shimmer.

172
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,790
Sunset Shimmer?

173
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,250
- You've heard of her?
- Sort of...

174
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,560
I don't think
I've seen you around before.

175
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,930
Did you just transfer to Canterlot High
from another school?

176
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,080
Yes! Another... school!

177
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,010
My name's Twilight.

178
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,150
I'm... Fluttershy.

179
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,240
Sorry, what was that?

180
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,050
It's Fluttershy!

181
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,190
It sounds like you're saying Fluttershy,
but how can that...?

182
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,170
Oh, my goodness!
Who's this sweet little guy?

183
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,660
That's Spike! My, uh... dog!

184
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,650
Oh, he's so cute!

185
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,910
Go on, eat up, little pup!

186
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,390
Wouldn't you just give anything
to know what they're really thinking?

187
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,380
He usually just tells me.

188
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,250
Oh, what do you mean?

189
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,350
Oh, uh, nothing! Never mind.

190
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,010
Sunset Shimmer said
you picked something up.

191
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,840
Something that belonged to her.

192
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,810
It wasn't a crown, was it?

193
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,640
How did you know?

194
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,080
Uh, lucky guess?

195
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,480
Do you still have it?

196
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,910
But you know what happened to it.

197
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,230
This morning, I was passing out
flyers for the animal shelter

198
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,240
<i>like I do every Wednesday.</i>

199
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,120
Canterlot's animal shelter
needs more volunteers.

200
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,400
Won't you help an animal
that can't help itself?

201
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,800
<i>I have no idea how it got there. </i>

202
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,534
But I didn't want anything
to happen to it,

203
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:46,050
so I decided to give it
to Principal Celestia.

204
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,220
Principal Celestia?
She's the ruler here?

205
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,510
You could say that.

206
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,770
Technically, I guess she and
Vice Principal Luna do make the rules.

207
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,450
- Where is she now?
- Probably in her office.

208
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,470
Third door on your left.

209
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,680
Thank you!

210
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,860
Oh, wait!

211
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,120
You're not really supposed
to have pets on school grounds.

212
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,270
Might wanna tuck him
into your backpack.

213
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,850
That's what I do!

214
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,970
They just get so lonely
when I'm in school all day.

215
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,790
Oh, okay! Thank you!

216
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,140
Oh, no! I'm late for class!

217
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,780
Come in.

218
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,150
How may I help you?

219
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,060
My name's Twilight Sparkle.
I'm new here, and...

220
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,330
Well, I understand that Fluttershy found
a crown this morning and gave it to you.

221
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,540
Yes. I've had Vice Principal Luna
put it somewhere for safekeeping.

222
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:00,190
No idea how it ended up
in the front lawn.

223
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,100
Were you interested in running
for Princess of the Fall Formal this year?

224
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,150
Uh, no. Not exactly.

225
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,980
The truth is...
Well, the truth is I...

226
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,770
You see, the crown is actually...

227
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,730
Princess of the Fall Formal?

228
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,730
It's Canterlot High's big Fall dance.

229
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,900
- Like the Grand Galloping Gala!
- Grand Galloping Gala?

230
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,240
It was a big deal at my old school.

231
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,740
And was there a princess?

232
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:29,660
Yes, but she wasn't exactly a student.

233
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,230
Here at Canterlot High,

234
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,720
the students select one
of their peers to represent them.

235
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:36,330
She receives a crown
at the Fall Formal.

236
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,300
You asked me if I was interested
in running for Princess.

237
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,000
Can anyone run?

238
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,873
Yes. You just need to let the head
of the Fall Formal planning committee

239
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,460
know you'd like to be on the ballot.

240
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,020
Was there anything else?

241
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,850
Um, nope! That was it!

242
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,020
Well, if you do need anything else,
my door is always open.

243
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,610
Twilight, why didn't you just
tell her the crown was yours

244
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,860
- ...and ask for it back?
-  I was going to.

245
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,918
But imagine if one of them
showed up in Equestria

246
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,870
saying they came from a place
filled with tall,

247
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,300
fleshy, two-legged creatures
with these?

248
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,880
We'd think they were crazy!

249
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,390
Hmm. You make a good point.

250
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,250
Looks like if I want my crown back,

251
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,420
I'll have to become Princess
of the Canterlot High Fall Formal.

252
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,730
So that's what I'm gonna do!

253
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,690
And how exactly
do you plan on doing that?

254
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,480
I have no idea!

255
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,160
I know we've just met,

256
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:46,090
but I was wondering if you might
be able to help me with something.

257
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,430
Of course!

258
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,240
I've decided to run for
Princess of the Fall Formal, and–

259
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,230
Oh, gosh!

260
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,160
Sorry. It's just,
running for Fall Formal Princess

261
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,160
is a really bad idea.

262
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:01,970
Why?

263
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,960
Sunset Shimmer wants
to be Fall Formal Princess.

264
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,060
And when she wants something,
she gets it!

265
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,220
She'll make life awful for anyone
who stands in her way.

266
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,550
Just ask the girl who ran against her
for Princess of the Spring Fling.

267
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,630
I have to try!

268
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,160
I don't think you understand.

269
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,730
You'd have to convince everyone here
to vote for you instead of her.

270
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,060
The athletes.

271
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,900
The fashionistas.

272
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,410
The dramas.

273
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,320
The eco-kids.

274
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,660
The techies.

275
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,990
The rockers...

276
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,950
Why is everypony–

277
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,710
Everybody separated this way?

278
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,830
Maybe it was different
at your old school,

279
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,460
but at C.H.S.,
everybody sticks to their own kind.

280
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,700
One thing that they do have in common

281
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,500
is that they know Sunset Shimmer
is gonna rule the school until we graduate.

282
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,990
Not if I can help it!

283
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,820
So...

284
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,820
Where would I find the head
of the party planning committee?

285
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,660
Fluttershy said
she'd probably be in here.

286
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:14,850
Incoming!

287
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,910
Hi, my name's Twilight Sparkle and...

288
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,180
Pinkie Pie?

289
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,910
Are you psychic?!

290
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,320
Uh, no. I don't think so.

291
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,820
Unless of course that's something
you can do here.

292
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,330
Not usually.

293
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,466
Fluttershy said this is where

294
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:43,826
I'd find the head of the
Fall Formal planning committee.

295
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,490
Fluttershy, huh?

296
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,464
Don't let the whole "shy" thing fool you.

297
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,071
She can be a real meanie.

298
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,040
You two aren't friends?

299
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,360
Waited a bit to get your name
on the ballot, huh?

300
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,200
Dance is day after tomorrow.

301
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:57,450
I'm brand new here.

302
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,550
I thought you didn't look familiar.

303
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,930
Though, now that
I'm really lookin' at you...

304
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,150
Do you have a twin sister who lives
in the city, has a pet dog named Spike

305
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,840
that looks just like that one?

306
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,180
- Uh, maybe?
- Thought so.

307
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,760
Anywho, just need to fill this out
and you are officially up for the coveted

308
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,770
Princess of the Fall Formal crown.

309
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,280
You have really bad handwriting.

310
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,630
It's like you've never
held a pen before.

311
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,280
Is it?

312
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,500
Somebody order a dozen cases
of fizzy apple cider?

313
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,770
Oh! Oh! Me, me-me-me, me,
yeah, ha ha, me!

314
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,720
- Can you bring in the rest?
- Eeyup.

315
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,190
- Hey, I know you.
- You do?

316
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,250
Sure. You're the new girl who gave
Sunset Shimmer the what for today.

317
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,530
Twilight Sparkle here is going
to run against Sunset Shimmer

318
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,550
for Princess of the Fall Formal.

319
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,730
I'd think twice about that.

320
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,600
Oh, sure, she'll probably
approach you all friendly like...

321
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:26,140
<i>"I sure am lookin' forward
to some friendly competition."</i>

322
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,130
<i>"That's so good to hear!"</i>

323
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,790
But then,
here comes the backstabbin'.

324
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,680
About the only girl in this school
you can trust less than Sunset Shimmer

325
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,380
is Rainbow Dash.

326
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,800
Rainbow Dash?

327
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,070
She's the captain of, like,
every team at Canterlot High.

328
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,300
She's also the captain of sayin'
she's gonna do somethin' for ya,

329
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,120
and then turnin' around
and not even botherin' to show up.

330
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,769
Thanks for the advice, Applejack.

331
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:52,051
But this is something
I really need to do.

332
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,730
Suit yourself.

333
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,990
Hey, how'd you know
my name was Applejack?

334
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,740
- Didn't you say?
- Nope.

335
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,080
Well, it sure was sure nice
meeting you both.

336
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,870
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

337
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,940
That one's trying to hide a secret,
but I am totally on to her.

338
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,830
She's psychic!

339
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,320
If you say so.

340
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,900
This looks terrible!

341
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,040
There should be more streamers
near the stage and fewer balloons.

342
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,820
Yeah, streamers!

343
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,050
And fewer balloons!

344
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,700
Fizzy apple cider?

345
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,070
This is my coronation,
not a hoedown!

346
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,140
Well, now,

347
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,720
it ain't necessarily gonna be
your coronation this time around.

348
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,760
Oh, is that so?

349
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,620
You country folk
really aren't that bright.

350
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,600
Must be why the other students
say such awful things about you.

351
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,330
Obviously it's gonna be MY coronation.

352
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,550
I'm running unopposed.

353
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,770
Not this time.
The new girl just signed up!

354
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,020
What?!

355
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,100
I know.
Her handwriting is really bad.

356
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,360
Where is this Twilight Sparkle?

357
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,610
I'm looking forward
to meeting the competition!

358
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,720
Can't believe
I didn't recognize you earlier.

359
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,720
Should've known Princess Celestia would
send her prized pupil here after my crown.

360
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,550
And her little dog, too.

361
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,560
It's MY crown!

362
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,890
Whatever.
This is just a minor setback for me.

363
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,008
You don't know the first thing
about this place,

364
00:25:50,138 --> 00:25:52,140
and I already rule it.

365
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,830
If that's so,
why do you even need my crown?

366
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,410
You went to an awful lot of trouble
to switch it with the one that belongs here.

367
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,522
Pop quiz:

368
00:25:59,652 --> 00:26:03,750
what happens when you bring an
Element of Harmony into an alternate world?

369
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,240
You don't know? Seriously?

370
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,740
And you're supposed to be
Princess Celestia's star student?

371
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,690
Then again, what were the chances
she'd find somepony as bright as me

372
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,710
to take under her wing
after I decided to leave Equestria?

373
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,530
Bit embarrassing that you
were the best she could do.

374
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,830
Oh, and I'd keep an eye on your mutt.

375
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,730
Hate for him to be...
taken away from you.

376
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,800
Is that a threat?

377
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,980
Oh, of course not.

378
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,190
But I'd cut down on the chatter
if I were you.

379
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,150
Don't want everyone to know you two
don't belong here, now would you?

380
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,580
You want to be a princess here?
Please.

381
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,630
You don't know the first thing
about fitting in.

382
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,340
I want you to follow her.

383
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,000
Bring me something I can use
just like you did with that last girl

384
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,260
who thought she could challenge me.

385
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,660
You got it, Sunset Shimmer.

386
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,810
When the crown
and its power are mine,

387
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,820
Twilight Sparkle will be sorry
she ever set hoof into this world!

388
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:24,520
Not that she would've been much safer
if she'd stayed in Equestria.

389
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:28,220
Yeah, in Equestria.

390
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,680
What are you still doing here?!

391
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,950
Go!

392
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,730
Excuse me.

393
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,140
The Great and Powerful Trixie!

394
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,000
...Needs some peanut butter crackers.

395
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,690
Voilà!

396
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,710
Sunset Shimmer is right.

397
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:15,020
I don't know the first thing
about this place.

398
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,300
If I'm gonna really fit in
and win votes,

399
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,040
we need to do some research.

400
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,160
Research?

401
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:24,680
This place has a school.
I have to believe it's got a...

402
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,740
library!

403
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:30,600
Got your phone?

404
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,030
Got yours?

405
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,430
So I just push the letters here,

406
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,220
and then the words and moving
pictures will come up here?

407
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,790
That's right.

408
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,930
Maybe this place does have magic.

409
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,610
<i>When you're a younger–</i>

410
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,680
Girls! What are you doing?

411
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,940
We're just seeing how many hits
our new music video has gotten.

412
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,570
<i>So the three of us
will fight the fight...</i>

413
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,400
No, just...

414
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,930
No!

415
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,570
The school computers are
for research purposes only.

416
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,400
It's just as well, y'all.

417
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:34,220
Some of the comments about our song
were really awful.

418
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,240
"Epic Fail."

419
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,070
"Funniest thing I've ever seen"?!

420
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,710
Funniest thing they've ever seen,
huh?

421
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,330
Uh, I don't know that
that's what you should take from...

422
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,560
<i>The library will be closing
in five minutes. </i>

423
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,020
I hadn't even thought about
where we're going to sleep tonight!

424
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,110
Way ahead of you.

425
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,670
It's a little... dusty.

426
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,030
But it doesn't seem like
anybody comes up here

427
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,370
It's perfect, Spike.

428
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,460
- So, how did your research go?
- I found this book.

429
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,250
It's called a yearbook.

430
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,815
It seems to be something
they use to keep a record of things

431
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:12,510
that have happened at the school.

432
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,010
Look. That's Pinkie Pie,

433
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,680
Rainbow Dash, Applejack,
Fluttershy...

434
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,680
and I'm gonna bet
the girl on the far right is Rarity.

435
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,480
There's a Rarity here!?

436
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,930
Uh, I mean, uh... interesting photo.

437
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,080
It's interesting because
they look like they're friends.

438
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:31,150
They do look like our friends.

439
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,120
But I thought
we figured that out already.

440
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,700
No, I mean...

441
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,150
they look like they're friends
with each other.

442
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,080
But it doesn't seem like
they're friends now.

443
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,660
Not so much.

444
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,698
I just can't help but get the feeling

445
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,910
that Sunset Shimmer
had something to do with it.

446
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,080
I wouldn't put it past her.

447
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,256
But she wanted your crown

448
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,840
'cause she's planning on doing
something even worse!

449
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,516
If you're gonna stop her,

450
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,500
you have to focus
on making friends here.

451
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,980
Can't worry about why
these girls aren't friends anymore.

452
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:04,200
Even if they do remind you
of your Ponyville friends.

453
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,200
You're right, Spike.

454
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,190
Eye on the prize.

455
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,240
<i>Good morning, students,
and happy Thursday.</i>

456
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:19,150
<i>Just a reminder to pick up your ballots
for the Princess of the Fall Formal today.</i>

457
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,230
<i>They are due at the time
the dance starts tomorrow night, </i>

458
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,700
<i>so don't forget to turn them in
and make your voice heard. </i>

459
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,450
Fluttershy said I'd need to win over
all those different groups

460
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,710
if I want to become
Princess of the Fall Formal.

461
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,920
So I've compiled
a list of talking points.

462
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,130
You made a list?
That's so unlike you!

463
00:32:38,781 --> 00:32:41,370
Uh... Please. Continue.

464
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,310
I'll start introducing myself.

465
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,640
Sprinkle in some things I've learned
about their world into the conversation.

466
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,550
Show them how I fit in here!

467
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,230
Okay, Spike.

468
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,070
Time to make a good first impression
on my fellow students.

469
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,080
The whole world
sort of depends on it.

470
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,700
Hey, look.

471
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,300
Why is everybody looking at me funny?

472
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,460
What're you...? Why did you...?

473
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,800
Rarity?

474
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:31,980
Oh, yes. This is good!
No one will recognize you!

475
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,530
Why wouldn't I want to be–

476
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,230
And we'll need a disguise for your dog.

477
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,740
Which is too bad.
He really is so adorable!

478
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,263
You know, with a little work,

479
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:44,150
I think I could make him
look like a rabbit instead.

480
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,780
A rabbit?

481
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,660
There you are, Twilight.

482
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,920
So much for the disguise.

483
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,580
I've been lookin' all over for ya!

484
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,930
- Me too.
- Me three!

485
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,670
I like your new look!

486
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,950
I do have an eye
for these sorts of things.

487
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,480
Not that you seem to care.

488
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,590
What?!

489
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,040
Why do you think she doesn't care?

490
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,320
No, never mind.

491
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,841
Why were you all looking for me?

492
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,300
What's going on?

493
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,930
She hasn't seen it yet.

494
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,280
Seen what?

495
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,530
Oh, it's really not that bad.

496
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,600
<i>Twilight Sparkle wants to be
your Fall Formal Princess.</i>

497
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:29,430
<i>What does it say about our school
if we give someone like this...</i>

498
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,840
<i>such an important honor? </i>

499
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,580
I take that back.
It's pretty bad!

500
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,630
But this all happened yesterday!
At the library!

501
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,400
Has everyone in the school seen this?

502
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,970
Is that why they were
all looking at me that way?

503
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,310
What am I gonna do?

504
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,750
No one is gonna vote for me
after seeing this!

505
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,270
Not that it'll make any difference,
but I'll still vote for you.

506
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,600
You were so nice to stand up for me
when Sunset Shimmer

507
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,623
was picking on me yesterday.

508
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,250
If you still wanna run, maybe
there's something I can do to help!

509
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,060
Word of advice?
Don't accept her help.

510
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,490
She doesn't take anything seriously!

511
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,410
Why do you have to be
so awful to me?

512
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,280
Don't play innocent, Pinkie Pie!
You are no better than she is!

513
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,200
And what is that supposed to mean?!

514
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,700
I am happy to offer up
my assistance as well.

515
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,960
To someone who would appreciate
what I have to offer!

516
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,130
Listen to y'all carryin' on! 
Get over it and move on! 

517
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:45,570
You mean like how you've gotten over
what happened with Rainbow Dash? 

518
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,100
She said she'd get the softball team
to make an appearance at my bake sale.

519
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,320
I tell everybody they're comin',
and then not one of them shows up!

520
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,240
She made a liar outta me!
That's different! 

521
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,580
Is not! 

522
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,440
Is too! 

523
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,580
STOP! 

524
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,000
All of you! 

525
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,980
I wanna show you something. 

526
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,300
You were friends once. 

527
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,640
The Freshman Fair. 

528
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:18,560
- Y'all remember?
- Yes.

529
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,820
But something happened. 

530
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,380
I think that something
was Sunset Shimmer. 

531
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,340
Well, it's a nice theory, darling,

532
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,150
but Sunset Shimmer
had nothing to do with it. 

533
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,330
She's right.

534
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,590
Sunset Shimmer isn't the one who ruined
my silent auction for the animal shelter 

535
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,050
by bringing fireworks
and noisemakers!

536
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,490
It was supposed to be a serious event,
and Pinkie Pie ruined it! 

537
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,500
What are you talking about?

538
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,320
I got a text from you saying
that you didn't want a silent auction. 

539
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,390
You wanted a big party! 

540
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,990
I never sent you a text! 

541
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,300
You didn't? 

542
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,880
You don't think she's the one who's
been sending me those e-mails, do you?

543
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,750
Every time I volunteer to help
with the decorations at a school function, 

544
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,310
I get an e-mail from Pinkie Pie saying
she has plenty of volunteers!

545
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,600
And then I find out
she's done everything herself. 

546
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:04,740
I never sent you any e-mails! 

547
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:08,670
Maybe she's the reason Rainbow Dash
didn't show up for my bake sale! 

548
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,450
Didn't you ever ask Rainbow Dash
why she didn't show up? 

549
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,750
I guess I kinda stopped talking
to her at all after that. 

550
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,550
Maybe now would be
a good time to start. 

551
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,130
They're actually talking!
That's a good sign! 

552
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,010
Hugs! Hugs are always good! 

553
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:42,760
Somebody, and I think
we can all guess who,

554
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,020
told Rainbow Dash that my bake sale
had been moved to a different day.

555
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,030
Dash showed up with all the softball team
and thought I'd cancelled on her! 

556
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,430
So you're looking
to dethrone Sunset Shimmer 

557
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,880
and become
Princess of the Fall Formal, huh? 

558
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:59,790
Gotta say, I'd really
love to see that happen.

559
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,630
I'll totally help you out!
All you gotta do...

560
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,970
is beat me in a game of one-on-one. 

561
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:06,120
What? 

562
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,260
First to five goals wins. 

563
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,000
One-zip! 

564
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,740
That's game! 

565
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:12,580
I really thought you were gonna...
pull it off there in the end!

566
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,120
So what's the plan? 

567
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,560
How can I help you be princess
instead of Sunset Shimmer? 

568
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,420
But... 

569
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,860
But... I... 

570
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,830
But... I... lost! 

571
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,510
Of course you lost. I'm awesome!

572
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,050
But I'm not gonna help just anybody
try and beat Sunset Shimmer.

573
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,300
The Fall Formal Princess should be
someone with heart and determination.

574
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,150
You've proved
that you've got 'em both! 

575
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,110
And can I get mine with extra oats? 

576
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,530
Oats? 

577
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:56,680
Scratch that. 

578
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,910
However you normally make it is fine. 

579
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,610
We've got to stop bumping
into each other like this. 

580
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,530
You know me! 

581
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:18,460
Always trying to make
a big splash around here.

582
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:22,430
'Cause my drink kinda splashed...
on the ground! 

583
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,140
I'm gonna go over there now. 

584
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,240
Don't even think about it! 

585
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,260
You're already trying to get her crown. 

586
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,370
Who knows what Sunset Shimmer would do
if you ended up getting her ex-boyfriend too? 

587
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,870
I'm not trying to. I don't even know...
We just accidentally... 

588
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,500
Ex-boyfriend? 

589
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,450
Flash Sentry broke up with her
a few weeks ago. 

590
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,750
I can't believe she hasn't done
something awful to him yet. 

591
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,890
Maybe she's just waiting until she has
the power to do something really awful. 

592
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,220
All right, girls. 

593
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,006
Dance is tomorrow night, and we still
don't know how we're gonna get Twilight 

594
00:41:06,136 --> 00:41:08,060
the votes she needs
to be named princess.

595
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,560
Right now, folks only know
the Twilight from the videos 

596
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,360
Sunset Shimmer posted online. 

597
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,780
We need to help them
see her differently. 

598
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,610
I'VE GOT IT!

599
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,120
I mean, perhaps I have a solution.

600
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,130
Now this may be
an absolutely preposterous idea, 

601
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,670
but what if we all wore these
as a sign of unity?

602
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,770
Freshman year, they were very,
very popular.

603
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,920
A way for everybody
to show their school spirit!

604
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,650
You know?
"Go, Canterlot Wondercolts!" 

605
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,640
I haven't sold any in ages.

606
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,510
I mean, the five of us
are obviously very different, 

607
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,850
but deep down,
we're all Canterlot Wondercolts!

608
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,810
Sunset Shimmer is the one
who divided us.

609
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,070
Twilight Sparkle is the one
who united us.

610
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,330
And we're gonna let everyone know it! 

611
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,570
What do you think? 

612
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,260
<i>Hey! Hey! Everybody! </i>

613
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,590
<i>We've got something to say</i>

614
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,300
<i>We may seem as different</i>

615
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,390
<i>As the night is from day</i>

616
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,690
<i>But you look a little deeper,
and you will see</i>

617
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,100
<i>That I'm just like you</i>

618
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,680
<i>And you're just like me</i>

619
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,480
Yeah! 

620
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,350
<i>Hey! Hey! Everybody!</i>

621
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,700
<i>We're here to shout</i>

622
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,820
<i>That the magic of friendship </i>

623
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,180
<i>Is what it's all about. </i>

624
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,330
<i>Yeah, we thought we were different </i>

625
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:36,380
<i>As the night is from the day</i>

626
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,420
<i>Until Twilight Sparkle
helped us see another way</i>

627
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,670
<i>So get up, get down
if you're gonna come around</i>

628
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,760
<i>We can work together
helping Twilight win the crown</i>

629
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:51,290
<i>So get up, get down</i>

630
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,350
<i>'Cause it's gonna make a sound</i>

631
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,520
<i>If we work together</i>

632
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,030
<i>Helping Twilight Sparkle 
win the crown</i>

633
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,260
<i>Hey! Hey! Hands up now! </i>

634
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,400
<i>We're sending a message to the crowd! </i>

635
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,570
<i>Hands wave up, then come down</i>

636
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,820
<i>We party together all around! </i>

637
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,850
<i>Generous, honesty</i>

638
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,120
<i>Laughter, kindness, loyalty</i>

639
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,300
<i>Twilight helped us each to see</i>

640
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,480
<i>All that we can be</i>

641
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,880
<i>So get up, get down</i>

642
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:18,960
<i>If you're gonna come around</i>

643
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,200
<i>We can work together
helping Twilight win the crown</i>

644
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,550
<i>So get up, get down</i>

645
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,550
<i>'Cause it's gonna make a sound</i>

646
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,050
<i>If we work together</i>

647
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,430
<i>Helping Twilight Sparkle
win the crown</i>

648
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,900
<i>I'm gonna be myself</i>

649
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,140
<i>No matter what I do</i>

650
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,050
<i>And if we're different, yeah,
I want you to be true to you</i>

651
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,610
<i>If you follow me,
we'll put our differences aside</i>

652
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,900
<i>We'll stick together
and start working on that school pride! </i>

653
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,320
<i>Jump up, make a sound</i>

654
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,910
 Hey!

655
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,250
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around</i>

656
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,370
<i>Start now, make a change</i>

657
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,960
<i>Gonna come around</i>

658
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,930
<i>Jump up, make a sound</i>

659
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:02,540
 Hey!

660
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,740
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around</i>

661
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:08,510
<i>Canterlot Wondercolts,
help her win the crown</i>

662
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,510
<i>Jump up, make a sound</i>

663
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,200
 Hey!

664
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:13,140
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around</i>

665
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:15,180
<i>Start now, make a change</i>

666
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,100
<i>Gonna come around</i>

667
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,050
<i>Jump up, make a sound</i>

668
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:19,530
 Hey!

669
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,740
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around</i>

670
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:25,430
<i>Canterlot Wondercolts,
help her win the crown</i>

671
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,040
<i>Jump up, make a sound</i>

672
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,190
<i>Stomp your hooves, turn around</i>

673
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,370
<i>Start now, make a change</i>

674
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,200
<i>Gonna come around</i>

675
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,350
Take those off! 

676
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,750
I have something I need you to do. 

677
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,730
Doesn't everyone look just fabulous? 

678
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,860
It was a great idea, Rarity! 

679
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,550
Don't know what she's smilin' about. 

680
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,650
Twilight's the one that's gonna
be Princess of the Fall Formal. 

681
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:15,910
Vice Principal Luna! 

682
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,650
Something terrible has happened! 

683
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:23,950
Isn't this just awful? 

684
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,550
And after Pinkie Pie worked so hard
to make things so perfect!

685
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,140
Why would Twilight Sparkle
do something like this? 

686
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,540
Why would you think Twilight
was responsible for something like this? 

687
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,010
Because I have proof. 

688
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,310
But... But I don't understand! 

689
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,480
This is clearly you in the photographs.

690
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,850
Is it not? 

691
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,830
Yes, but... 

692
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,650
I think it should be fairly obvious

693
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,740
that the school cannot let someone
who would do something like this 

694
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,750
compete for the Fall Formal crown. 

695
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,710
Vice Principal Luna. 

696
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,640
I found these in a trash can
in the library.

697
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,200
Thought you should see them. 

698
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,151
Someone obviously combined these photos

699
00:47:15,281 --> 00:47:17,800
to make it look like Twilight
was the one who trashed the gym. 

700
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,640
I appreciate you bringing these
to my attention, Flash.

701
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,230
In light of this new evidence,
you may of course continue your bid 

702
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,640
to be crowned
the Princess of the Fall Formal. 

703
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,790
Thank you! 

704
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,940
You have no idea how important
this is to me! 

705
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,780
What was I gonna do?
Not prove your innocence?

706
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,830
Wouldn't be much of a
Canterlot Wondercolt, would I? 

707
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,400
I am afraid enough damage
has been done to the gym 

708
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,960
that we will have to postpone
the dance until tomorrow night.

709
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:47,450
If you will excuse me, 

710
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,960
I need to let my sister know
about this latest development. 

711
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,840
So, uh, I was wondering. 

712
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,650
If you aren't already going
with somebody, 

713
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,970
wanna go to the Fall Formal
with me tomorrow night? 

714
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,140
That would be... 

715
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,100
Tomorrow night!?

716
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,560
No, no no no no no, no no no no no!
Nonononono!

717
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:09,360
I can't! The portal!
That'll be too late!

718
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,100
One "no" would have been fine! 

719
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,910
- Everything okay in there? 
- Yes!

720
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,150
Only it's not okay.
It's not okay at all! 

721
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,830
If I don't get my crown tonight, 

722
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,830
I won't be able to go back to Equestria
for another thirty moons!

723
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,470
What are we gonna do? 

724
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,370
We tell them the truth.

725
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,550
Let them know what's really at stake
if you don't get the crown tonight. 

726
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,600
They'll help us figure something out. 

727
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,200
But what if they won't?

728
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:50,760
What if when they find out
just how different I really am...? 

729
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:55,750
Twilight, these girls rallied around you
'cause they saw what was in your heart.

730
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,070
They aren't going to feel
any differently about you

731
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,990
when they find out you're
 pony princess in Equestria.

732
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,820
I'm glad you followed me here, Spike. 

733
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,200
Me too.

734
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,790
Unless of course we get stuck here
for another thirty moons. 

735
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,300
You okay? 

736
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,550
The Fall Formal
isn't happening tonight. 

737
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,710
WHAT!? 

738
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,100
It had to be postponed
because Sunset Shimmer 

739
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,220
had Snips and Snails
ruin all of Pinkie Pie's decorations. 

740
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,390
WHAT!? 

741
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,140
But the Fall Formal
has to happen tonight. 

742
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,390
You see... 

743
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,800
You're from an alternate world
and you're a pony princess there

744
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,941
and the crown actually has
a magical element embedded in it

745
00:49:38,071 --> 00:49:40,762
that helps power up other magical elements,
and without it they don't work anymore

746
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:42,280
and you need them to help
protect your magical world,

747
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:44,921
and if you don't get the crown tonight,
you'll be stuck in this world

748
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:47,696
and you won't be able to get back for,
like, a really, really long time!

749
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,330
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that isn't the reason. 

750
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,260
Nope, she's pretty much spot-on. 

751
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:58,510
He can talk!? 

752
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,667
Oh, yeah! 

753
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:02,330
And back where I come from,
I'm not even a dog!

754
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,650
I'm a ferocious,
fire-breathing dragon! 

755
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,890
This is so amazing! 

756
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,030
Tell me,
what are you thinking right now? 

757
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,160
Sure would love a scratch
behind the old ears! 

758
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,980
Uh, maybe later. 

759
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,850
- How did you know all that? 
- Just a hunch. 

760
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,700
Wait a minute!
Let me get this straight. 

761
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,430
You're a pony? 

762
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,400
You're a princess? 

763
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,830
You're from another world? 

764
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,980
That... is... 

765
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,760
awesome! 

766
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,930
See? Told you. 

767
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:48,810
I simply cannot believe
they did all this! 

768
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,200
If I only had some kind of party cannon 

769
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,850
that could decorate
everything super fast! 

770
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,020
I know it seems impossible, but,

771
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:58,450
maybe if we all work together? 

772
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,980
Now that's the kind of can-do spirit
I'm lookin' for in a Fall Formal Princess!

773
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,800
Let's do it, y'all! 

774
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:08,510
- Absolutely! 
- Rock on! 

775
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,250
<i>It's time for us to come together </i>

776
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:17,410
<i>It's the only way
that things will get better </i>

777
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,200
<i>It's time for us to take a stand </i>

778
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,090
<i>So come on and lend a helping hand </i>

779
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,170
<i>Fix it up,
yeah, it's all right </i>

780
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,680
<i>We'll get it ready by tonight </i>

781
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:36,930
<i>Mix it up,
yeah, help a friend</i>

782
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,110
<i>We'll come together in the end </i>

783
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,880
<i>It's time to show
that we've got school spirit </i>

784
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,440
<i>Raise your voice
and let everyone hear it </i>

785
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:55,960
<i>It's time to show that we're strong </i>

786
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,330
<i>So come on, everybody, sing along </i>

787
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,880
<i>Look how we've all come together </i>

788
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:13,920
<i>Things are only just
starting to get better </i>

789
00:52:15,730 --> 00:52:21,250
<i>Look how we've all come together </i>

790
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:28,950
<i>Things are only gonna get better,
better, better, better! </i>

791
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:33,150
<i>Fix it up,
yeah, it's all right </i>

792
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,080
<i>We'll get it ready by tonight </i>

793
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,970
<i>Mix it up,
yeah, help a friend </i>

794
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,460
<i>We'll come together in the end </i>

795
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,680
<i>Fix it up,
yeah, it's all right </i>

796
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:50,260
<i>We'll get it ready by tonight </i>

797
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:53,580
<i>Mix it up,
yeah, help a friend </i>

798
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:58,710
<i>We'll come together, together now! </i>

799
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,230
This... looks... sooooo... GOOD! 

800
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,080
All right, everyone!

801
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:15,410
Fall Formal is back on
for this evening.

802
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,460
So you'd better get out of here
and start getting ready.

803
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:24,630
Oh, and don't forget to cast your ballots
for the Fall Formal Princess on your way out! 

804
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,300
- You got my vote, Twilight. 
- Mine, too! 

805
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,100
- Mine too! 
- Mine too! 

806
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:36,100
You're lucky she was able
to pull this off.

807
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,560
Next time I ask you
to make a mess of things, 

808
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,730
try to show a little restraint!

809
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,550
I need this Formal to go on tonight
just as much as she does. 

810
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,830
I still can't believe
we pulled that off! 

811
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,330
I can! We're awesome! 

812
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,790
Enough chatter, girls. 

813
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,350
We need to get ready, 
and we need to look fabulous! 

814
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,570
<i>This is our big night </i>

815
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,570
<i>We're getting ready,
and we're doing it up right </i>

816
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,880
<i>This is our big night </i>

817
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:12,010
<i>Friendship survived,
now we'll start it out right</i>

818
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:17,460
<i>The time's right, gonna make it last
'cause it's the first night </i>

819
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:20,700
<i>That we're ever gonna
start to just have fun together </i>

820
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:24,700
<i>We're so glad,
so happy we could never be mad </i>

821
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:28,490
<i>Did it right,
now this is our big night now </i>

822
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:33,200
<i>Six friends on the way up now </i>

823
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:41,260
<i>Six friends here to show you how </i>

824
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,790
<i>This is our big night </i>

825
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:48,980
<i>We're getting ready,
and we're doing it up right </i>

826
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,840
<i>This is our big night </i>

827
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:56,430
<i>We made it happen, 
now let's party all night</i>

828
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,580
<i>This is our big night </i>

829
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,730
<i>This is our big night </i>

830
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,200
<i>This is our big night </i>

831
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:12,170
<i>This is our big night </i>

832
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:29,800
Twilight !

833
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,030
Look, I know you said "no"
about going to the Fall Formal with me, 

834
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,290
but would you reconsider
and at least have one dance? 

835
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:42,890
I didn't say "no"!
I mean, I did, but...

836
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,240
I didn't mean no, to you. 

837
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:47,530
I was... Well, what I mean is... 

838
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,720
Yes. I'd love to dance with you! 

839
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,550
Anybody seen Sunset Shimmer? 

840
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,000
Maybe she was too embarrassed to show!

841
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,700
She's gotta know
you won by a landslide! 

842
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,180
Maybe... 

843
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:32,570
First off, I want to say how wonderful
everything looks tonight.

844
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,848
You all did a magnificent job
pulling things together

845
00:56:34,978 --> 00:56:37,820
after the unfortunate events of earlier.

846
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:40,130
And now, without further ado,

847
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:44,370
I'd like to announce the winner
of this year's Fall Formal crown.

848
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,750
The Princess of this year's
Fall Formal is...

849
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,380
Twilight Sparkle!

850
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:05,750
Congratulations, Twilight. 

851
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,600
Twilight! Help! 

852
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:13,910
Spike?

853
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,860
They've got Spike! 

854
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,220
That's close enough! 

855
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:50,100
Twilight!

856
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:52,680
Don't hurt him! 

857
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:56,000
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.
I'm not a monster, Twilight.

858
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,400
Let him go.

859
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,500
You don't belong here. 

860
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:07,130
Give me the crown,
and you can go back to Equestria tonight.

861
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,570
Or keep it and never go home. 

862
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,260
Tick-tock, Twilight.
We haven't got all night.

863
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:17,340
The portal will be closing
on its own in less than an hour. 

864
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:20,990
So, what's your answer? 

865
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,850
- No. 
- What!?

866
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,360
Equestria! Your friends!
Lost to you forever! 

867
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:32,730
Don't you see what I'm about
to do to the portal?! 

868
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:33,520
Yes, 

869
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:37,120
but I've also seen what you've been
able to do here without magic.

870
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:41,120
Equestria will find a way to survive
without my Element of Harmony.

871
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:45,210
This place might not
if I allow it to fall into your hands.

872
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,860
So go ahead.
Destroy the portal. 

873
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:50,500
You are not getting this crown! 

874
00:58:51,610 --> 00:58:54,210
Fine. You win. 

875
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,550
You... are... so awesome! 

876
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,300
I can't believe
you were gonna do that for us! 

877
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,300
It's no wonder
you're a real live princess! 

878
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,790
Oh, yes, she's so very special!

879
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,760
Grab him, you fools! 

880
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,690
Spike, Spike!

881
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:42,130
Fluttershy!

882
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:56,270
I'll take that! 

883
00:59:57,310 --> 00:59:58,930
At last! 

884
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,700
More power than I could ever imagine! 

885
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,830
This is going to be so cool! 

886
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:15,650
I've had to jump through so many hoops
tonight just to get my hands on this crown

887
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:19,400
and it really should
have been mine all along.

888
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:24,470
But let's let bygones be bygones.

889
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:27,750
I am your princess now.

890
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,210
And you will be loyal... 

891
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,650
to me! 

892
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:53,210
Round them up and bring them
to the portal.

893
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,890
Spoiler alert:

894
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:02,400
I was bluffing when I said
I was going to destroy the portal.

895
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:05,640
I don't want to rule
this pathetic little high school.

896
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:08,110
I want Equestria! 

897
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,480
And with my own little
teenage army behind me, 

898
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:13,630
I am going to get it! 

899
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,620
No, you're not! 

900
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:20,560
Oh, please! 

901
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,860
What exactly do you think
you're going to do to stop me? 

902
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:28,700
I have magic,
and you have nothing! 

903
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,010
She has us! 

904
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,990
Gee, the gang really
is all back together again.

905
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,890
Now step aside!

906
01:02:45,020 --> 01:02:49,690
Twilight has tried to interfere with
my plans one too many times already!

907
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,040
She needs to be dealt with!

908
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,480
What!? 

909
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:12,099
The magic contained in my Element
was able to unite with those

910
01:03:12,229 --> 01:03:14,000
that helped create it! 

911
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:28,300
Honesty! 

912
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:36,140
Kindness! 

913
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,650
Laughter! 

914
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,250
Generosity! 

915
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,800
Loyalty! 

916
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,090
Magic

917
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:09,880
Together with a crown, they create a power
beyond anything you could imagine.

918
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:13,320
But it is a power you don't have
the ability to control!

919
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:16,090
The crown may be upon your head,
Sunset Shimmer, 

920
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,800
but you cannot wield it.

921
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,530
Because you do not possess
the most powerful magic of all: 

922
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:22,800
the magic of friendship! 

923
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:34,400
What is happening? 

924
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,450
Here and in Equestria, 

925
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:42,390
it is the only magic
that can truly unite us all! 

926
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,440
You will never rule in Equestria. 

927
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:32,130
Any power you may have had
in this world is gone.

928
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:35,450
Tonight, you've shown everyone
who you really are. 

929
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,780
You've shown them
what is in your heart. 

930
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:41,860
I'm sorry.

931
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:43,800
I'm so sorry. 

932
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:46,080
I didn't know there was another way. 

933
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:49,240
The magic of friendship
doesn't just exist in Equestria. 

934
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,080
It's everywhere. 

935
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,730
You can seek it out,
or you can forever be alone. 

936
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,850
The choice is yours.

937
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:02,960
But all I've ever done since being here
is drive everyone apart.

938
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:06,100
I don't know the first thing
about friendship. 

939
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:10,360
I bet they can teach you. 

940
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:12,720
Those are my girls! Woo-hoo! 

941
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:15,480
Did that dog just talk?
Whoa. Weird. 

942
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,530
Seriously? 

943
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,380
The talking dog is the weird thing
about all this? 

944
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,550
I, for one, think you're adorable. 

945
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:28,150
I believe this belongs to you.

946
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:33,540
A true princess in any world leads
not by forcing others to bow before her, 

947
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:36,970
but by inspiring others
to stand with her.

948
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,730
We have all seen that
you are capable of just that. 

949
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,960
I hope you see it too,
Princess Twilight. 

950
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:48,640
I do. 

951
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:56,650
Would now be a completely awkward time
to ask you for that dance? 

952
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:07,350
<i>This is our big night </i>

953
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,900
<i>We made it happen,
now let's party all night</i>

954
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:17,580
<i>We're here now and we worked
so hard to make it come around </i>

955
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,600
<i>To tonight so let's try
to make it last forever </i>

956
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:24,620
<i>The school lights so bright,
beat is pumping through the night</i>

957
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,390
<i>Party's starting,
DJ's got the music just right! </i>

958
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:34,330
<i>Six friends on the way up now </i>

959
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:41,040
<i>Six friends here to show you how </i>

960
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,570
<i>This is our big night </i>

961
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:48,600
<i>This is our big night </i>

962
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:53,700
<i>This is our big night </i>

963
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,620
You'll look out for her,
won't you? 

964
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:01,030
Of course we will. 

965
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:04,340
Although I do expect some sort of apology
for last spring's debacle. 

966
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:08,380
I have a feeling she'll be
handing out a lot of apologies. 

967
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:12,020
We better get going. 

968
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,680
I know we've only been friends
for a short time, 

969
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:18,480
but I'm gonna miss all of you so much. 

970
01:08:23,530 --> 01:08:25,340
That crown really does suit you...

971
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,110
Princess Twilight.

972
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,480
You know what, Spike?

973
01:08:28,481 --> 01:08:31,860
I am starting to feel a little
more comfortable wearing it. 

974
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,110
And the wings? 

975
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,750
I've been walking on two legs
and picking things up with these!

976
01:08:36,751 --> 01:08:37,790
Wings?

977
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:41,320
I'm thrilled that's all I'll be
dealing with back in Equestria! 

978
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,660
Bummer! 

979
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:11,550
Twilight!

980
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:14,990
- Ah, you're back! 
- You got your crown! 

981
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,290
I knew you could do it! 

982
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,290
Oh, we were so worried. 

983
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,790
Sunset Shimmer, is she alright? 

984
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:26,380
I think she's going to be fine.
I left her in good hands. 

985
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:29,050
What are hands? 

986
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,520
- Where did you stay? 
- What did they wear? 

987
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,300
- Did you have fun? 
- What'd you eat? 

988
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,520
Would you say she's just
as awesome as me? 

989
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:43,650
I want to tell you
all everything, I do,

990
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,110
but I'm just so exhausted
from all the dancing. 

991
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:47,110
Dancing? 

992
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:52,980
We've got to stop bumping
into each other like this. 

993
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:57,420
Who was that? 

994
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:59,660
He's a new member of the castle guard. 

995
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:01,370
Flash Sentry, I think.

996
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,840
Why? Do you know him? 

997
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,420
Not exactly. 

998
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:09,450
Somepony's got a crush
on the new guy! 

999
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:11,000
No. No, I don't. 

1000
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:14,330
She does! She absolutely does! 

1001
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,630
Don't be ridiculous.
I don't even know him. 

1002
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,890
He just... 

1003
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:20,850
Totally reminds you of a guy you met in the
other world who played guitar, was in a band

1004
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,020
and helped prove you didn't destroy
all the decorations for a big dance, 

1005
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:25,260
so you could still run
for princess of the big dance,

1006
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,340
and then asked you
to dance at that dance!

1007
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:28,850
Right? 

1008
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,070
How did you know that? 

1009
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:33,070
Just a hunch! 

1010
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:55,370
<i>A friend for life,
that's what you are to me </i>

1011
01:10:55,630 --> 01:11:02,080
<i>A friend for life,
that's what you are to me </i>

1012
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:06,270
<i>I couldn't see what was
right there in front of me </i>

1013
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:09,860
<i>Turned my back
and my mind off track, yeah </i>

1014
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:13,120
<i>You saw a world,
there was something new entirely </i>

1015
01:11:13,250 --> 01:11:17,160
<i>Helped me to see
all the possibilities </i>

1016
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:24,340
<i>Oh, like a star in the daylight,
or like a diamond at night</i>

1017
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:29,920
<i>Your light was hidden 
from my sight </i>

1018
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:36,020
<i>A friend for life,
that's what you are to me </i>

1019
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:43,200
<i>A friend for life,
that's what you are to me </i>

1020
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,200
<i>Every friendship is tested</i>

1021
01:11:47,330 --> 01:11:50,870
<i>You say you're sincere
but it's all unclear now </i>

1022
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,270
<i>But with a word,
everything changes </i>

1023
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,100
<i>And just like that,
you and I are right back </i>

1024
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:05,200
<i>Oh, like a star in the daylight,
or like a diamond at night</i>

1025
01:12:05,970 --> 01:12:11,150
<i>The light will shine
